Prevent leaking API keys, access tokens, passwords and other sensitive data by
keeping them out of your codebase. Secret Scanner detects and alerts you when
secrets are committed in your code and configuration in a GitHub repository. It
helps prevent secrets from being exposed by adding a failed GitHub Check when a
secret is detected.

It also supports adding patterns to detect other secrets not detected by default
by this skill.

-   Scan for any type of secret — just add your own secret patterns
-   Support for exceptions — ignore secrets like sample keys
-   Control exactly which secrets to detect and which files to scan
