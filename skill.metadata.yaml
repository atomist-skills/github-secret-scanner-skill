    tooltip: "By default, all files (**/*) in selected repositories will be scanned. This setting can be used to restrict the files you want to scan. For example, to only scan YAML files with .yaml or .yml extensions at any depth in the repository, you would provide this glob pattern: *.{yaml,yml}."
